**Prerequisites**
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Git
Node.js (which comes with npm)

**Getting Started**
Follow these steps to get a local copy up and running:

1. Clone the Repository
To clone the project to your local machine, run the following command in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/lockej2005/olive-learn.git
Navigate into the project directory:

cd olive-learn
2. Install Dependencies
Inside the project directory, install the necessary packages:

npm install
3. Start the React Application
Run the following command to start the React app:

npm start
This command will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. By default, the app will be available at http://localhost:3000/.

4. Edit the Application
Now you can begin editing the application. The source code is located in the src directory. As you make changes to the code, the application will automatically reload in the browser, reflecting your changes in real time.
